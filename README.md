Welcome. If you are here to help, great, and a bug to report is even better. So to help go to code and look for a mod that piques your interest and find a bit to help with. I am sure that there are likely issues bound to pop up which is helpful if the person identifies the mod the issue is from.

Issues are to be labeled as so:

[mod name], [type of issue (conflicting mod, dialogue, usage of items, etc.)]
The error message, any coding that shows up on the screen. The situation [if the game/mod didn't crash loading.

IMPORTANT; Artists, spriters, and extra coders, are helpful.
